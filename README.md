# Open in CMDER

Thanks to ziyasal's [open-in-cmd](https://github.com/lmatt-bit/atom_open_in_cmd).

Thanks to ziyasal's [open-conemu-here](https://github.com/ziyasal/atom-open-conemu-here), I can create "open_in_cmd" package. With "open_in_cmd", User can open a CMD in Atom directly from tree-view & editor.  

Note: This package is only enabled on Windows.
